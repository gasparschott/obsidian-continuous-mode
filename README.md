# obsidian-continuous-mode

An Obsidian plugin that displays all open notes in a tab group as if they were a single continuous document (sometimes called "Scrivenings mode").  

## Features: 

#### File and Editor Contextual Menus:
 - Toggle continuous mode in active tab group.
 - Show/hide note headers in active tab group.

#### File Explorer Contextual Menu:  
 - Open all files from selected folder in Continuous Mode. Currently only markdown files, images (bmp, jpg, jpeg, gif, png, svg, webp), and pdfs are opened.  
 - Open or append files from selected folder in active tab group; files from the folder will not be duplicated if they are already open.  
 - Replace active tab group with files from selected folder: i.e., close all open notes in active tab group and replace with folder items.  

#### Command Palette:  
 - Toggle continuous mode in active tag group.
 - Show/hide note headers in active tab group.
 
#### Other functions:  
 - Navigate between notes with up and down arrow keys (and left and right arrow keys if at the beginning or end of the note).
   - Also use left and right arrow keys to scroll html notes or jump from page to page in pdfs.
 - Notes scroll into view when tab header is clicked.
 - Reorder notes via tab header drag-and-drop.
 - Save and restore continuous mode tab group settings when shutting down/starting up Obsidian.
